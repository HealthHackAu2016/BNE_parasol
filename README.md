## The Problem

Scientific research (and particularly medical research) involves the distribition of research datasets between disparate organisations, quite often using no more sophisticated mechanism than an Excel spreadsheet - which while it can have it's uses, is quite difficult to search and filter through large amounts of data of potentially poorly structured data.

As an example, Divya (project owner) needs to perform studies, for which she needs to select samples from a large dataset of available samples that are relevant to the field of research that the study is examining.

Prior to Parasort, the approach for identifying these samples is a lengthy manual process of examining all the rows in the database, and identifying relevant samples - something that results frequently results in errors.

## The Solution

Parasort massively simplifies this process by allowing this Excel database to be validated (to standardise and structure the data according to user defined rules), and imported into a queryable database.

Using these rules, queryies can be easily constructed as required to deliver high quality results from the database in a fraction of the time.
